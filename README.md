Given my career has been mostly dedicated to trading and portfolio management in many different capacities - as a prop-trader, quantitative manager, as well as a more short to medium-term discretionary investment standpoint - I thought it would be most interesting for me to do some research on the biggest fintech black-box ever.  Renaissance Technologies is potentially the most secretive black-box quant firm in existence. It may be one of the least understood companies in the history of markets.  The outsized returns of RenTech's Medallion Fund, has consistently beaten the market in beta adjusted terms since 1988.  It was noted in the book ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’ by Greg Zuckerman, that RenTech’s flagship Medallion Fund generated 66% annualized returns before fees and 39% after fees, from 1988-2018.  This makes Berkshire and Buffet - as well as every other hedge fund I know of - look like amateur hour.  As noted by Nick Maggiulli in his article, ‘Why the Medallion Fund is the Greatest Money-Making Machine of All Time’: 

“To put this performance in perspective, $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period.  Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have only grown to $100 during this time. 
This means that the Medallion Fund outperformed one of the best asset classes of the last few decades by 1,000x and one of the best investors of all time by 200x!”

What might be even more impressive, is that they’ve only lost money one time net of fees in that period, while maintaining a negative correlation with the SPX.

While I’m not sure we can come to any conclusions on how RenTech is able to do what they do, I thought it would be fitting - given my background - to explore the most tech and quant driven of all the quant funds in the world - RenTech. (Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you are the Charlie-Browniest RenTech.)

## Overview and Origin:

### Name of company

Renaissance Technologies or ‘RenTech’ as it is known on the street 
https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true 

### When was the company incorporated?

Founded in 1982 

### Who are the founders of the company?

Jim Simons/James Harris Simons

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Interestingly, Jim Simons was a mathematician and cold-war code breaker, who is quoted as saying “I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute.  I want models that will make money while I sleep- A pure system without humans interfering."  Simons, didn’t enter investing until he was in his 40’s.  Prior to that, he was an award winning mathematician, worked in code breaking during the Cold War, and built a world-class math department at Stony Brook.  During his days as a code breaker, he learned signal processing and interpretation - which basically is tantamount to finding meaningful signals in seemingly meaningless/unconnected data.  Essentially, at inception, Simon’s fund was employing low-level machine learning, or pattern recognitiion, before anyone else.  They continue to seem to be better than anyone else today, despite machine learning/neural networks/AI type investing and programming being readily available to most firms.  

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

It is unclear how the firm was initially funded from a money standpoint.  However, the firm’s flagship ‘Medallion Fund’ is only open to friends and family, so the funding for the firm’s most notable strategy is mostly internal at this point, and capped from new investments.

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

In the most comprehensive book on RenTech/Simons, ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’, we get a hint via title as to what RenTech hoped to (did?) achieve.  They sought quantitative models to beat the market, that limited human interaction with the strategies after research was completed.  This isn’t to suggest research isn’t/wasn’t ongoing in this firm, it is more to suggest that the firm employed a more black-box approach to investing - which we will detail more about in this case study.  The firm has essentially made a business out of taking 10+ terabytes of data per day and more and creating investment ideas on the fly via data from these signals. On quant trading - it is people, not machines that are responsible for the more interesting aspects of so called black-box quant models.  For the most part, machines don’t create the initial quant ideas, they are just used for implementation.  In that, it is interesting to note that while it doesn’t get more ‘FinTech’ than RenTech - there are still people that are the core of designing these black-box/quant processes. That said, it seems as though RenTech has taken quant/black-box investing to new climbs, in that RenTech is using signal processing and potentially other methods to identify the trades.  This is different from many black-box alpha strategies, as we will see later. 

So what is a black-box/quant model anyways?  It is simply a systematic, automated, and data driven methodological approach to investing.  People still select the research process, data, universe of securities.  In the data, humans have to know where to look and what is valuable.  For RenTech, it seems like - from the knowledge we have - that they are using algorithms to create the models and the trades around those models.  This is divergent from the way other black-boxes are implemented.  

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

This is a very tough question.  The ‘intended customer’ is anyone that wants to become incredibly rich with seemingly very little - relatively speaking of course- risk.  I’d imagine that pool of people is quite large - possibly most people on earth.  However, and perhaps most interestingly, the Medallion Fund’s pool or targetted AUM has limits, as black-box strategies have limits in implementation due to things like small versus large fund effects.  This is simply put as that is is easier to generate higher returns in smaller funds - as liquidity becomes a non-issue at lower sizes.  We notice this very often in my own emerging market background.  Trading 20mm of something is very different in EM than it is trading 500k of the same thing. In that, the Medallion Fund is likely not scalable beyond some size ‘X’, despite the attractiveness of making a ton of money. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This is also very tough to answer about RenTech.  They could potentially be the biggest ponzi scheme ever - or brilliant scientists that have ‘solved’ markets.  What do they offer that other black-box strategies don’t?  This is nearly impossible to figure out.  What I think would make sense is to detail black-box trading, and suggest possible angles this firm might be different than others, given the vast marketplace/type distinctions in the black-box world.  It is seemingly better analysis of similar data sets, that differentiates RenTech from every other firm. In that, some research on so called black-box models is necessary. The ‘secret sauce’ is clearly people driven, as one of the keys to the success of RenTech has been hiring the true best and brightest in science, math, stats, comp sci, physics, and astrophysics. Those people have employed sophisticated algorithms, scientific method, and large-scale computing power and infrastructure, to sift through data for meaningful signals.  This group of scientists coupled with massive computing power, grants RenTech a somewhat unfair advantage in sifting through market data.  They have both brains (actual geniuses) and the braun (large computing infrastructure and access to high speed/high volume data sources), which grants them some competitive advantages.  That said, other firms have similar access with dissimilar results.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

As quipped in ‘The Economist’ in 2010 - "There's Renaissance Technologies, and then there's everyone else."  This quote speaks volumes, as RenTech has access to data that everyone else has access to, but they somehow have figured out ways to interpret broad sets of data better than any other firm on the planet.  How?  There is some sense, that they have done something special that no one else is able to achieve. With that in mind, it might make more sense to go through potential black-box approaches and see how these might be utilized by RenTech. 

As previously mentioned, as far as quant trading is concerned, it is people, not machines that are responsible for the more interesting aspects of so called ‘black-box’ quant models.  For the most part, machines don’t create the initial quant ideas, they are just used for implementation.  In that, it is interesting to note that while it doesn’t get more ‘FinTech’ than RenTech - there are still people that are the core of designing these black-box/quant processes.  However, a key difference seems to be that RenTech sets out to solve the problem differently.  The scientists aren’t looking for anything specific.  They aren’t creating models and testing if they work.  The scientists/programmers tell the programs to go to work finding the signals - and the computers generate and trade those signals.  In that RenTech is opening up and covering thousands of short and medium term positions at any given time.  Robert Mercer, a key manager at RenTech noted that they really are only right 50.75% of its trades - but of those - they are always right. That slight edge, over 10’s of millions of trades done at a fast enough speed, was able to generate these sort of fantasy level returns.  (This also suggests that RenTech with all this trading, is incredibly good at lowering trading costs - also incredible by itself.) 

Cornell also notes:

So what is a black-box/quant model anyways?  It is simply a systematic, automated, and data driven methodological approach to investing.  People still select the research process, data, universe of securities.  In the data, humans have to know where to look and what is valuable.  For RenTech, it seems like - from the knowledge we have - that they have algorithms and processes that are better at dealing with data than other black-box/quant shops.

# Alpha Models - How do average quants make money?

This is the part of the model looking to make money over market beta.  It quantifies the value add above a market move.  The alpha model is designed to time markets, choose securities, and security sizing, in order to beat the market and add returns. 

What are typically in alpha models:

Theory driven science is typically what we see around us.  We see something and create a hypothesis we which to prove through science.  Empirical science is based on data without the hypothesis. 

So there are two types of 'quant buckets' theory driven quant traders vs. empirical driven quant traders (RenTech is empirically driven quant trading firm) 

Example Theory:  Cheap stocks will outperform expensive ones

Empirical: Just looks for patterns of these different types of stocks or any other asset - this is differentiator for quants.  ‘Data mining’ vs. Theory driven scientists are both driven by observation.  Empiricists are less concerned with figuring out the ‘why’ something is happening - only that it is in fact happening.  This is a RenTech take on markets vs. other theory driven quant models. Even if the correlation is spurious - that doesn’t matter. If the signal is repeatable with enough edge to it - empirically driven quants will pile into this repeatable pattern.  Theoretical science would want the rationale - then to backtest it - then to implement it.  In this, RenTech may have better empirical models to pick out/data mine micro trends in markets. 

Most quants fall into very predictable buckets, in that, black-boxes are often highly systematized versions of discretionary trading decision metrics:
 
- Trend following - based on price data
- Mean reversion - based on price data 
- Value/Yield - fundamental data
- Growth - fundamental data
- Quality - fundamental data

These, for the most part are EXACTLY what a discretionary trader would measure - albeit in a less formal way.  I like X stock because it is dramatically oversold - something a discretionary trader would say vs. I like X stock because it is dramatically oversold on a scoring metric and the computer buys it based on this - what a quant would say - are not dramatically different.  Formalization of observation in a systematic way is the core of what most quant shops and black-boxes do. 

In fact, romanticizing the black-box is pretty silly if we consider what they are really trying to achieve.  It isn’t largely dissimilar from discretionary- it is just systematized and often data/computer driven.  

Take an example from my work:

We would look at currencies in several different ways.  

Carry
Momentum
Valuation
Fundamentals

(All of these **COULD** be mathematically driven, but you could also just say hey ‘this currency has high carry, the country has good dynamics, valuation is cheap, and momentum is turning positive’.  The quant would seek to formalize these buckets.  Further, the quant might look for patterns in the data that might tell us if momentum is indeed improving, valuation is in fact ‘good’, fundamental direction, and using risk adjusted carry metrics that could also tell us something about the potential for sharpe enhancement.)

The idea that the average quant shop/black-box is ‘mysterious’ and ‘secretive’ seems mostly false.  They are simply doing some interesting things with rather pedestrian inputs.  Seemingl though, RenTech is doing things a little differently.  They'd have to be to have the performance they have.  So what are they POTENTIALLY doing different from competitors.    

Again, it’s difficult to say where RenTech is sourcing its clear empirical edge but… 

What RenTech MAY do better than anyone else:

**Signal processing**

It is said that RenTech - via various algorithms - is able to find signals that are inperceptible to humans without computers - using signal processing algorithms/machhine learning. Howver, it seems like the algorithms (potentially some application of the Baum-Welch algorithm) are used much more efficiently in RenTech than elsewhere. It appears that RenTech finds patterns - thousands of them - in very basic data - and finds signals that work 50.75% of the time and are magnified at each trade via leverage with long short positions.  So take something like two very similar companies.  The machines would be scrubbing data and trades on a micro level basis, looking for signals that humans can't see.  If that signal is replicated several times - it may be SLIGHTLY more likely to be replicated again.  So if Exxon Mobil is trading like garbage relative to XOM on upticks, and all else equal, the pattern recognition might grab that CVX stock and sell XOM in a short term levered way.  Keeping balanced, on a sector and company basis, the firm would truly be 'hedged' against everything but a company specific smash-up. However, it is **LIKLELY** (read: certain) that computers immediately would unwind XOM on negative read headlines/signals.  In this, if they capture these micro signals OVER AND OVER again, they could reliably:

1.) Eliminate most market/systematic risk
2.) Eliminate most sector risk
3.) Eliminate transactions costs through higher speed connections/market making/fill algos
4.) Use statistical arbitrage on higher volatility- yet factor matched - positions and close those mean reversion gaps on micro scales over and over

As Robert Mercer said - we want to win 50.75% of the time 100% of the time.  That tiny inperceptible signal they found and traded on - say it makes .2% very quickly over the course of the signal.  They are also levered, so that number might annualize out to something absurd.  

The firms algorithms seem to not bother to test hypotheses, the data itself is the signal, and the ability to process massive amounts of data, and tease out signals, is the process itself.  Taking seemingly unconnected and untradable information and making it tradeable is their business. So this is essentially a process of taking data, signal processing, and feature extraction that is fully automated via algorithms that aren’t well understood.

All in, it is extremely difficult to say with any certainty, how RenTech exactly does what it does, but my sense is they continue to use machine learning/empirical science (data mining) while using proprietary algorithms to maximize the strength and speed of signal processing.  These signals, are scrubbed off terabytes of data on a daily basis, then signals are traded into a portfolio with matched factor loadings at a security and portfolio level, in order to minimize systematic/beta risk.  Then RenTech depends on micro to mini-scale mean reversion in each of these security positions based on the factor loadings.  They then lever these 50.75% wins into hundreds of tiny trades that make casino style edge.  They likely enter and exit these positions through some very smart algorithms to eliminate - or even profit from the trades on a market making basis. Given there is a negative correlation to SPX/other factor beta risks, the above methodology is likely the only way they could do what they do.  

The question is - are other quant shops just that bad?  Or are these guys just that good? Or is this just the world overcomplicating something that isn't complicated? We may never know the answer.  Is it ultra efficient/smart signal processing using some sort of kernel based machine learning? The secret sauce is clearly the algorithms the people have created.  This should be aspirational and inspirational for all investors.  Assuming this isn't some sort of a fraud, it shows us all that we can be better.  What one man can do, another can too. 

## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

RenTech is a quantitative/systematic investment management firm.  

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The major trends in investing have been a move to more quantitative domains, away from discretionary investing.  In this, RenTech was a pioneering firm that, unlike LTCM, did not blow up, and has experienced very little in terms of losses during extreme market events. It seems likely, that more movement towards automation, data, and so called ‘black-box’ models, remains the future for the investment management industry.  Traditional forces in investing:  value, carry, momentum, statistical arbitrage/mean reversion et al., are becoming the norm, as discretionary managers disappear.  This is mostly happening because net of fees, most discretionary managers have proven a pervasive inability to beat markets over the long term.  In this, it is unclear that quant strategies outside of anomalies like RenTech, will be able to do much better.  The problem is that once a signal is identified, it is often traded away - or in other scenarios- reversed by markets and used against the herd when the knowledge of the signal is saturated.  This sort of signal decay, makes RenTech’s long term success that much more notable.  They are either a criminal ponzi scheme - or one (or more) steps ahead of every other quant shop.  

### What are the other major companies in this domain?

Citadel, DE Shaw, AQR, Bridgewater, BlueCrest, Point72, Two-Sigma

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

This firm is the stuff of legend.  It is the holy grail of investing, in that everyone wants to know how they do what they do.  Having worked on the street I’ve only known one person from RenTech.  My sense was that speaking about what they do wasn’t even possible for most employees. This person was a high level trading employee - with management responsibilities of the money - so completely front office.  He couldn’t or wouldn’t say in any way how they do what they do. The influence on RenTech has likely been enormous from a market participant psyche perspective.  As they say - ‘what one man can do - another can too…’ - but in this case NO ONE has been able to figure out their recipe for spinning hay into gold.  This lore/legend will continue to press market participants to innovate and try and emulate RenTech’s strategies and wins.  (I’d imagine leaving RenTech might look a lot like Tom Cruise in Grisham’s ‘The Firm’.)  

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

When we go through investment performance, there a lot of directions you could take analysis and ways to look at the performance data.  Some ways of thinking about it:

Absolute returns vs. relative returns - Investors always would like to know how they did in absolute returns - which is simply the percentage they made over the year.  However, we also have to adjust returns on relative basis to judge success relative to a benchmark.  In this, if you ran an fund benchmarked to say - SPOOs - and SPX was up 20% and you were up 18% on the year - you would have an 18% absolute return - but a garbage result on a relative basis.  This of course **COULD** be better than it looks.  Why?  Well you have to risk adjust returns as well.  What if the risk (vol/skewness/kurtosis) of the +18% was only half of that of the SPX?  In this, we might have a weaker return on a relative basis, but a very happy result on a risk adjusted return basis.  Loosely defined, the outperformance of a fund - above an expected beta - is alpha.  In that, if you took a ton of risk and beat the SPOOs- congrats - you made more money- but you did so by taking more risk.  This is critically where RenTech also shines.  As noted above, the funds not only seem to take a negative correlation to overall market beta, but generate higher returns doing so.  It’s difficult to say what the true.   

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

RenTech, as mentioned, has achieved godlike dominance of their field.  This dominance, is almost worthy of suspicion, as it SEEMED like the only HF (not necessarily quant driven) was Madoff’s with such an impressive record.  The question becomes - Did RenTech discover alchemy in so far as ‘solving’ the markets as the book suggests Jim Simon’s did? ( I am not sure we can find a strong answer here, but suffice it to say, RenTech is either one of the most unique examples of innovation in markets - or an incredible fraud of some sort.  That said, it is unlikely they are a Madoff style fraud.  It would be too complicated in this day and age to get away with something like that.  The avenues would be similar to a Madoff, but not as available in this case.  (Perhaps the only way I see it as possible is that RenTech could still have great models, which are highly successful in their own right OUTSIDE of the Medallion Fund, and they use those other funds to ‘goose’ the Medallion Fund returns somehow.  In that - no one complains because the other funds are ‘good’ - but not Medallion-like - and Medallion is benefitted by some sleight of hand.  Again, not accusing, but it wouldn’t be the first time someone has seemed like a god, only to found out later to be very very mortal.)

Overall, very little academic work has been done on RenTech’s Medallion fund, but it flies in the face, in the most blatant and discouraging way, of the EMH - or efficient market hypothesis.  If RenTech’s style could work into perpetuity, it would suggest markets aren’t that efficient after all, and in fact - highly ‘beatable’.  The best academic findings out there on this fund were put forth by Bradford Cornell, a UCLA professor, in his piece entitled, ‘The Medallion Fund: The Ultimate Counterexample?’.   In it, Cornell notes:

> The performance of Renaissance Technologies’ Medallion fund provides the ultimate counterexample to the hypothesis of market efficiency. Over the period from the start of > trading in 1988 to 2018, $100 invested in Medallion would have grown to $398.7 million, representing a compound return of 63.3%. Returns of this magnitude over such an > > > extended period far outstrip anything reported in the academic literature. Furthermore, during the entire 31-year period, Medallion never had a negative return despite the > dot.com crash and the financial crisis. Despite this remarkable performance, the fund’s market beta and factor loadings were all negative, so that Medallion’s performance > cannot be interpreted as a premium for risk bearing. To date, there is no adequate rational market explanation for this performance.

Cornell notes that $100 invested in this fund would have grown to $398mm dollars from 1998 to 2018.  This is in stark contrast to a market based return on $100, growing to only $1900.  That is how insane this fund is in a nutshell. Also notable in the data set (included from the book ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’ which is also in Cornell’s paper), is that the returns DO NOT fall off relative to the size of the fund.  Whatever was working at $20mm fund size is also working at $10bb capped fund size. This by itself is incredible.  

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Unfortunately, there is a scaling issue with many black-box type quantitative models.  Certainly, anyone invested in the Medallion Fund has to be very happy with performance, as each year they grow and grow and become more and more wealthy invested in the fund.  With compound growth like that, it’s likely that people in the fund could achieve a financial standing most could only dream of, starting at a very low level investment.  In that, I’m hesitant to believe there is a product offering that RenTech could make. They have **THE** product.  That said, throughout the history of the firm, it seems like they achieved new scalability by entering new markets.  Perhaps, things with harder to source information, but consequently less efficient markets, may actually be a way to grow the firm more.  RenTech has done this in the past, moving from commodities to equities, so perhaps maybe even less efficient markets might work with some of the quantitative proficiencies the firm has developed, in order to expand. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

In terms of offerings, some of the tactics enlisted by RenTech might be so interesting to markets, that simply opening up about some of the employed tactics - without specifics - could change the face of markets in a meaningful way.  It may be a legacy vanity play for Simons and the rest of the firm to shed some light on how they do things there.  That aside, expanding into more difficult markets might ultimately lead to greater investment scalability across a wider range of offerings.  This may include emerging markets.   

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

These would simply utilize existing computing structures which scrub through 10+ terabytes of data a day. 

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

There isn't much RenTech gets wrong.  I'd say the guess work posited here is as good as I've seen in resources avaiable.  It
