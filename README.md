Given my career has been mostly dedicated to trading and portfolio management in many different capacities - as a prop-trader, quantitative manager, as well as a more short to medium-term discretionary investment standpoint - I thought it would be most interesting for me to do some research on the biggest fintech black-box ever.  Renaissance Technologies is potentially the most secretive black-box quant firm in existence. It may be one of the least understood companies in the history of markets.  The outsized returns of RenTech's Medallion Fund, has consistently beaten the market in beta adjusted terms since 1988.  It was noted in the book ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’ by Greg Zuckerman, that RenTech’s flagship Medallion Fund generated 66% annualized returns before fees and 39% after fees, from 1988-2018.  This makes Berkshire and Buffet - as well as every other hedge fund I know of - look like amateur hour.  As noted by Nick Maggiulli in his article, ‘Why the Medallion Fund is the Greatest Money-Making Machine of All Time’: 

“To put this performance in perspective, $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period.  Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have only grown to $100 during this time. 
This means that the Medallion Fund outperformed one of the best asset classes of the last few decades by 1,000x and one of the best investors of all time by 200x!”

What might be even more impressive, is that they’ve only lost money one time net of fees in that period, while maintaining a negative correlation with the SPX.

While I’m not sure we can come to any conclusions on how RenTech is able to do what they do, I thought it would be fitting - given my background - to explore the most tech and quant driven of all the quant funds in the world - RenTech. (Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you are the Charlie-Browniest RenTech.)

## Overview and Origin:

### Name of company

Renaissance Technologies or ‘RenTech’ as it is known on the street 
https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true 

### When was the company incorporated?

Founded in 1982 

### Who are the founders of the company?

Jim Simons/James Harris Simons

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Interestingly, Jim Simons was a mathematician and cold-war code breaker, who is quoted as saying “I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute.  I want models that will make money while I sleep- A pure system without humans interfering."  Simons, didn’t enter investing until he was in his 40’s.  Prior to that, he was an award winning mathematician, worked in code breaking during the Cold War, and built a world-class math department at Stony Brook.  During his days as a code breaker, he learned signal processing and interpretation - which basically is tantamount to finding meaningful signals in seemingly meaningless/unconnected data.  Essentially, at inception, Simon’s fund was employing low-level machine learning, or pattern recognitiion, before anyone else.  They continue to seem to be better than anyone else today, despite machine learning/neural networks/AI type investing and programming being readily available to most firms.  

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

It is unclear how the firm was initially funded from a money standpoint.  However, the firm’s flagship ‘Medallion Fund’ is only open to friends and family, so the funding for the firm’s most notable strategy is mostly internal at this point, and capped from new investments.

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

In the most comprehensive book on RenTech/Simons, ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’, we get a hint via title as to what RenTech hoped to (did?) achieve.  They sought quantitative models to beat the market, that limited human interaction with the strategies after research was completed.  This isn’t to suggest research isn’t/wasn’t ongoing in this firm, it is more to suggest that the firm employed a more black-box approach to investing - which we will detail more about in this case study.  The firm has essentially made a business out of taking 10+ terabytes of data per day and more and creating investment ideas on the fly via data from these signals. On quant trading - it is people, not machines that are responsible for the more interesting aspects of so called black-box quant models.  For the most part, machines don’t create the initial quant ideas, they are just used for implementation.  In that, it is interesting to note that while it doesn’t get more ‘FinTech’ than RenTech - there are still people that are the core of designing these black-box/quant processes. That said, it seems as though RenTech has taken quant/black-box investing to new climbs, in that RenTech is using signal processing and potentially other methods to identify the trades.  This is different from many black-box alpha strategies, as we will see later. 

So what is a black-box/quant model anyways?  It is simply a systematic, automated, and data driven methodological approach to investing.  People still select the research process, data, universe of securities.  In the data, humans have to know where to look and what is valuable.  For RenTech, it seems like - from the knowledge we have - that they are using algorithms to create the models and the trades around those models.  This is divergent from the way other black-boxes are implemented.  

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

This is a very tough question.  The ‘intended customer’ is anyone that wants to become incredibly rich with seemingly very little - relatively speaking of course- risk.  I’d imagine that pool of people is quite large - possibly most people on earth.  However, and perhaps most interestingly, the Medallion Fund’s pool or targetted AUM has limits, as black-box strategies have limits in implementation due to things like small versus large fund effects.  This is simply put as that is is easier to generate higher returns in smaller funds - as liquidity becomes a non-issue at lower sizes.  We notice this very often in my own emerging market background.  Trading 20mm of something is very different in EM than it is trading 500k of the same thing. In that, the Medallion Fund is likely not scalable beyond some size ‘X’, despite the attractiveness of making a ton of money. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This is also very tough to answer about RenTech.  They could potentially be the biggest ponzi scheme ever - or brilliant scientists that have ‘solved’ markets.  What do they offer that other black-box strategies don’t?  This is nearly impossible to figure out.  What I think would make sense is to detail black-box trading, and suggest possible angles this firm might be different than others, given the vast marketplace/type distinctions in the black-box world.  It is seemingly better analysis of similar data sets, that differentiates RenTech from every other firm. In that, some research on so called black-box models is necessary. The ‘secret sauce’ is clearly people driven, as one of the keys to the success of RenTech has been hiring the true best and brightest in science, math, stats, comp sci, physics, and astrophysics. Those people have employed sophisticated algorithms, scientific method, and large-scale computing power and infrastructure, to sift through data for meaningful signals.  This group of scientists coupled with massive computing power, grants RenTech a somewhat unfair advantage in sifting through market data.  They have both brains (actual geniuses) and the braun (large computing infrastructure and access to high speed/high volume data sources), which grants them some competitive advantages.  That said, other firms have similar access with dissimilar results.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

As quipped in ‘The Economist’ in 2010 - "There's Renaissance Technologies, and then there's everyone else."  This quote speaks volumes, as RenTech has access to data that everyone else has access to, but they somehow have figured out ways to interpret broad sets of data better than any other firm on the planet.  How?  There is some sense, that they have done something special that no one else is able to achieve. With that in mind, it might make more sense to go through potential black-box approaches and see how these might be utilized by RenTech. 

As previously mentioned, as far as quant trading is concerned, it is people, not machines that are responsible for the more interesting aspects of so called ‘black-box’ quant models.  For the most part, machines don’t create the initial quant ideas, they are just used for implementation.  In that, it is interesting to note that while it doesn’t get more ‘FinTech’ than RenTech - there are still people that are the core of designing these black-box/quant processes.  However, a key difference seems to be that RenTech sets out to solve the problem differently.  The scientists aren’t looking for anything specific.  They aren’t creating models and testing if they work.  The scientists/programmers tell the programs to go to work finding the signals - and the computers generate and trade those signals.  In that RenTech is opening up and covering thousands of short and medium term positions at any given time.  Robert Mercer, a key manager at RenTech noted that they really are only right 50.75% of its trades - but of those - they are always right. That slight edge, over 10’s of millions of trades done at a fast enough speed, was able to generate these sort of fantasy level returns.  (This also suggests that RenTech with all this trading, is incredibly good at lowering trading costs - also incredible by itself.) 

Cornell also notes:

“Returns of the level reported by Medallion could hardly be interpreted as risk premiums. In fact, it is difficult to speak of risk regarding Medallion because the fund never experienced a negative annual return. The fund did have a large standard deviation of returns, 31.7%, but that was around an arithmetic mean of 66.1%, implying a Sharpe ratio of exceeding 2.0. As to systematic risk, a regression of Medallion’s excess returns on the CRSP market index produces a beta of approximately -1.0 so that in addition to its extraordinary performance Medallion also offered a hedge against market risk. A three-factor regression adding the Fama and French (1996) variables SMB and HML reveals that loadings on both factors are also negative, though neither is statistically significant. Whatever the source of Medallion’s returns, it is not a reward for risk bearing.”

So what is a black-box/quant model anyways?  It is simply a systematic, automated, and data driven methodological approach to investing.  People still select the research process, data, universe of securities.  In the data, humans have to know where to look and what is valuable.  For RenTech, it seems like - from the knowledge we have - that they have algorithms and processes that are better at dealing with data than other black-box/quant shops.

Alpha Models - How do average quants make money?

This is the part of the model looking to make money over market beta.  It quantifies the value add above a market move.  The alpha model is designed to time markets, choose securities, and security sizing, in order to beat the market and add returns. 

What are typically in alpha models:

Theory driven science is typically what we see around us.  We see something and create a hypothesis we which to prove through science.  Empirical is based on data without the hypothesis. 
Theory driven quant traders vs. empirical driven quant traders (RenTech is empirically driven quant trading shop.) 

Theory:  Cheap stocks will outperform expensive ones. 
Empirical: Just looks for patterns of these different types of stocks or any other asset - this is differentiator for quants.  ‘Data mining’ vs. Theory driven scientists are both driven by observation.  Empiricists are less concerned with figuring out the ‘why’ something is happening - only that it is in fact happening.  This is a RenTech take on markets vs. other theory driven quant models. Even if the correlation is spurious, it doesn’t matter if it is repeatable with enough edge to it - empirically driven quants will pile into this repeatable pattern.  Theoretical science would want the rationale - then to backtest it - then to implement it.  In this, RenTech may have better empirical models to pick out/data mine micro trends in markets. 

Most quants fall into very predictable buckets:
 
Trend following - based on price data
Mean reversion - based on price data 
Value/Yield - fundamental data
Growth - fundamental data
Quality - fundamental data

These, for the most part are EXACTLY what a discretionary trader would measure - albeit in a less formal way.  I like X stock because it is dramatically oversold - something a trader would say vs. I like X stock because it is dramatically oversold on a scoring metric and the computer buys it based on this - what a quant would say - are not dramatically different.  Formalization of observation in a systematic way is the core of what most quant shops and black-boxes do. 

In fact, romanticizing the black-box is pretty silly if we consider what they are really trying to achieve.  It isn’t largely dissimilar from discretionary- it is just systematized and often data/computer driven.  

Example from my work:

We would look at currencies in several different ways.  

Carry
Momentum
Valuation
Fundamentals

(All of these **COULD** be mathematically driven, but you could also just say hey ‘this currency has high carry, the country has good dynamics, valuation is cheap, and momentum is turning positive’.  The quant would seek to formalize these buckets.  Further, the quant might look for patterns in the data that might tell us if momentum is indeed improving, valuation is in fact ‘good’, fundamental direction, and using risk adjusted carry metrics that could also tell us something about the potential for sharpe enhancement.)

The idea that the average quant shop/black-box is ‘mysterious’ and ‘secretive’.  That is mostly false.  They are doing some interesting things with rather pedestrian inputs.  Seemingly, this isn’t so regarding RenTech.  

Again, it’s difficult to say where RenTech is sourcing its clear empirical edge but… 

What RenTech MAY do better than anyone else:

Signal processing
While at IDA, Simons had briefly investigated applying an algorithm developed by Lenny Baum and Lloyd Welch to financial markets (the Baum-Welch algorithm uses data to uncover hidden states in a Markov chain process)

Simons, either directly or through spin-offs that he oversaw, subsequently hired several additional staff members, including James Ax, a prominent number theorist; Elwyn Berlekamp, a prominent expert in coding theory, game theory and computer science; Rene Carmona, an expert in stochastic differential equations; and Nick Patterson, whom Simons had known at IDA. Together these researchers developed some new techniques and software that appeared to work quite well. Although there were setbacks, their investment fund, later renamed the “Medallion Fund” (reportedly a nod to the awards that Simons, Ax and others had received) started growing, from $20 million in 1988 to $66 million in 1993.
At this point, Simons concluded that he needed some additional high-powered expertise in computer science and machine learning. So he hired IBM researchers Robert Mercer and Peter Brown, who had been developing speech recognition techniques at IBM’s Yorktown Heights Research Laboratory. Mercer and Brown further improved the fund’s algorithms, data processing facilities and trading software, resulting in significant new gains. Simons then hired additional mathematicians and computer scientists, together with an eclectic group of physicists, astronomers and signal processing experts, hardly any of whom had training in business or finance.

Simons’ background hardly suggested that he would one day lead one of the most successful, if not the most successful, quantitative hedge fund operation in the world.
Born in 1938 to a Jewish family that operated a small shoe factory, Simons aspired very early to be a mathematician, ultimately receiving a B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the age of 20, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley at the age of 23. His doctoral thesis presented a new proof of Berger’s classification of the holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds. Later, in collaboration with Shing-Shen Chern, he discovered and proved what is now known as the Chern-Simons theorem (and associated theory), which deals with 3-dimensional quantum field theory and also has applications in string theory and quantum computing. For this and some related work, in 1976 he received the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry.
The firms algorithms seem to not bother to test hypotheses, the data itself is the signal, and the ability to process massive amounts of data, and tease out signals, is the process itself.  Taking seemingly unconnected and untradable information and making it tradeable is their business. So this is essentially a process of taking data, signal processing, and feature extraction that is fully automated via algorithms that aren’t well understood.
