Given my career has been mostly dedicated to trading and portfolio management in many different capacities - as a prop-trader, quantitative manager, as well as a more short to medium-term discretionary investment standpoint - I thought it would be most interesting for me to do some research on the biggest fintech black-box ever.  Renaissance Technologies is potentially the most secretive black-box quant firm in existence. It may be one of the least understood companies in the history of markets.  The outsized returns of RenTech's Medallion Fund, has consistently beaten the market in beta adjusted terms since 1988.  It was noted in the book ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’ by Greg Zuckerman, that RenTech’s flagship Medallion Fund generated 66% annualized returns before fees and 39% after fees, from 1988-2018.  This makes Berkshire and Buffet - as well as every other hedge fund I know of - look like amateur hour.  As noted by Nick Maggiulli in his article, ‘Why the Medallion Fund is the Greatest Money-Making Machine of All Time’: 

“To put this performance in perspective, $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period.  Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have only grown to $100 during this time. 
This means that the Medallion Fund outperformed one of the best asset classes of the last few decades by 1,000x and one of the best investors of all time by 200x!”

What might be even more impressive, is that they’ve only lost money one time net of fees in that period, while maintaining a negative correlation with the SPX.

While I’m not sure we can come to any conclusions on how RenTech is able to do what they do, I thought it would be fitting - given my background - to explore the most tech and quant driven of all the quant funds in the world - RenTech. (Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you are the Charlie-Browniest RenTech.)

## Overview and Origin:

### Name of company

Renaissance Technologies or ‘RenTech’ as it is known on the street 
https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true 

### When was the company incorporated?

Founded in 1982 

### Who are the founders of the company?

Jim Simons/James Harris Simons

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Interestingly, Jim Simons was a mathematician and cold-war code breaker, who is quoted as saying “I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute.  I want models that will make money while I sleep- A pure system without humans interfering."  Simons, didn’t enter investing until he was in his 40’s.  Prior to that, he was an award winning mathematician, worked in code breaking during the Cold War, and built a world-class math department at Stony Brook.  During his days as a code breaker, he learned signal processing and interpretation - which basically is tantamount to finding meaningful signals in seemingly meaningless/unconnected data.  Essentially, at inception, Simon’s fund was employing low-level machine learning, or pattern recognitiion, before anyone else.  They continue to seem to be better than anyone else today, despite machine learning/neural networks/AI type investing and programming being readily available to most firms.  

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

It is unclear how the firm was initially funded from a money standpoint.  However, the firm’s flagship ‘Medallion Fund’ is only open to friends and family, so the funding for the firm’s most notable strategy is mostly internal at this point, and capped from new investments.

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

In the most comprehensive book on RenTech/Simons, ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’, we get a hint via title as to what RenTech hoped to (did?) achieve.  They sought quantitative models to beat the market, that limited human interaction with the strategies after research was completed.  This isn’t to suggest research isn’t/wasn’t ongoing in this firm, it is more to suggest that the firm employed a more black-box approach to investing - which we will detail more about in this case study.  The firm has essentially made a business out of taking 10+ terabytes of data per day and more and creating investment ideas on the fly via data from these signals. On quant trading - it is people, not machines that are responsible for the more interesting aspects of so called black-box quant models.  For the most part, machines don’t create the initial quant ideas, they are just used for implementation.  In that, it is interesting to note that while it doesn’t get more ‘FinTech’ than RenTech - there are still people that are the core of designing these black-box/quant processes. That said, it seems as though RenTech has taken quant/black-box investing to new climbs, in that RenTech is using signal processing and potentially other methods to identify the trades.  This is different from many black-box alpha strategies, as we will see later. 

So what is a black-box/quant model anyways?  It is simply a systematic, automated, and data driven methodological approach to investing.  People still select the research process, data, universe of securities.  In the data, humans have to know where to look and what is valuable.  For RenTech, it seems like - from the knowledge we have - that they are using algorithms to create the models and the trades around those models.  This is divergent from the way other black-boxes are implemented.  

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

This is a very tough question.  The ‘intended customer’ is anyone that wants to become incredibly rich with seemingly very little - relatively speaking of course- risk.  I’d imagine that pool of people is quite large - possibly most people on earth.  However, and perhaps most interestingly, the Medallion Fund’s pool or targetted AUM has limits, as black-box strategies have limits in implementation due to things like small versus large fund effects.  This is simply put as that is is easier to generate higher returns in smaller funds - as liquidity becomes a non-issue at lower sizes.  We notice this very often in my own emerging market background.  Trading 20mm of something is very different in EM than it is trading 500k of the same thing. In that, the Medallion Fund is likely not scalable beyond some size ‘X’, despite the attractiveness of making a ton of money. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This is also very tough to answer about RenTech.  They could potentially be the biggest ponzi scheme ever - or brilliant scientists that have ‘solved’ markets.  What do they offer that other black-box strategies don’t?  This is nearly impossible to figure out.  What I think would make sense is to detail black-box trading, and suggest possible angles this firm might be different than others, given the vast marketplace/type distinctions in the black-box world.  It is seemingly better analysis of similar data sets, that differentiates RenTech from every other firm. In that, some research on so called black-box models is necessary. The ‘secret sauce’ is clearly people driven, as one of the keys to the success of RenTech has been hiring the true best and brightest in science, math, stats, comp sci, physics, and astrophysics. Those people have employed sophisticated algorithms, scientific method, and large-scale computing power and infrastructure, to sift through data for meaningful signals.  This group of scientists coupled with massive computing power, grants RenTech a somewhat unfair advantage in sifting through market data.  They have both brains (actual geniuses) and the braun (large computing infrastructure and access to high speed/high volume data sources), which grants them some competitive advantages.  That said, other firms have similar access with dissimilar results.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

As quipped in ‘The Economist’ in 2010 - "There's Renaissance Technologies, and then there's everyone else."  This quote speaks volumes, as RenTech has access to data that everyone else has access to, but they somehow have figured out ways to interpret broad sets of data better than any other firm on the planet.  How?  There is some sense, that they have done something special that no one else is able to achieve. With that in mind, it might make more sense to go through potential black-box approaches and see how these might be utilized by RenTech. 

As previously mentioned, as far as quant trading is concerned, it is people, not machines that are responsible for the more interesting aspects of so called ‘black-box’ quant models.  For the most part, machines don’t create the initial quant ideas, they are just used for implementation.  In that, it is interesting to note that while it doesn’t get more ‘FinTech’ than RenTech - there are still people that are the core of designing these black-box/quant processes.  However, a key difference seems to be that RenTech sets out to solve the problem differently.  The scientists aren’t looking for anything specific.  They aren’t creating models and testing if they work.  The scientists/programmers tell the programs to go to work finding the signals - and the computers generate and trade those signals.  In that RenTech is opening up and covering thousands of short and medium term positions at any given time.  Robert Mercer, a key manager at RenTech noted that they really are only right 50.75% of its trades - but of those - they are always right. That slight edge, over 10’s of millions of trades done at a fast enough speed, was able to generate these sort of fantasy level returns.  (This also suggests that RenTech with all this trading, is incredibly good at lowering trading costs - also incredible by itself.) 

Cornell also notes:

“Returns of the level reported by Medallion could hardly be interpreted as risk premiums. In fact, it is difficult to speak of risk regarding Medallion because the fund never experienced a negative annual return. The fund did have a large standard deviation of returns, 31.7%, but that was around an arithmetic mean of 66.1%, implying a Sharpe ratio of exceeding 2.0. As to systematic risk, a regression of Medallion’s excess returns on the CRSP market index produces a beta of approximately -1.0 so that in addition to its extraordinary performance Medallion also offered a hedge against market risk. A three-factor regression adding the Fama and French (1996) variables SMB and HML reveals that loadings on both factors are also negative, though neither is statistically significant. Whatever the source of Medallion’s returns, it is not a reward for risk bearing.”

So what is a black-box/quant model anyways?  It is simply a systematic, automated, and data driven methodological approach to investing.  People still select the research process, data, universe of securities.  In the data, humans have to know where to look and what is valuable.  For RenTech, it seems like - from the knowledge we have - that they have algorithms and processes that are better at dealing with data than other black-box/quant shops.
