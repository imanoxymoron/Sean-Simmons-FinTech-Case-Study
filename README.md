**Renaissance Technologies ‘RenTech’**

Given my life has been mostly dedicated to trading and portfolio management, both in a prop-trading, quantitative, as well as a more short to medium-term discretionary investment standpoint, I thought it would be most interesting for me to do some research on the biggest fintech black-box ever.  Renaissance Technologies is potentially the most secretive black-box quant firm in existence. It may be one of the least understood companies in the history of markets - next to Madoff.  I don’t use that comparison lightly, as the outsized returns of this firms Medallion Fund, have consistently beaten the market in beta adjusted terms since 1988.  It was noted in the book ‘The Man Who Solved the Market’ by Greg Zuckerman, that RenTech’s flagship Medallion Fund generated 66% annualized returns before fees and 39% after fees, from 1988-2018.  This makes Berkshire and Buffet - as well as every other hedge fund I know of - look like amateur hour.  As noted by Nick Maggiulli in his article, ‘Why the Medallion Fund is the Greatest Money-Making Machine of All Time’: 

“To put this performance in perspective, $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period.  Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have only grown to $100 during this time. 
This means that the Medallion Fund outperformed one of the best asset classes of the last few decades by 1,000x and one of the best investors of all time by 200x!”

What might be even more impressive, is that they’ve only lost money one time net of fees in that period, while maintaining a negative correlation with the SPX.

While I’m not sure we can come to any conclusions on how RenTech is able to do what they do, I thought it would be fitting - given my background - to explore the most tech and quant driven of all the quant funds in the world - RenTech. (Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you are the Charlie-Browniest RenTech.)
